## #100DaysOfCode - Come Join the Fun!

Have you wanted to learn how to program but lacked the support? #100DaysOfCode is a formal (but flexible) process with a clear set of rules designed to motivate you. Part of the process involves sharing your goals and progress via social media and your files via GitHub, which is a free online repository website and version control service which many teachers are now using as an alternative to a traditional website.

Come learn how to get started and how the process works. You’ll especially benefit from this session if you never used GitHub and want to learn how easy it can be.

As a bonus, I will talk about how the #100DaysOfCode can be adapted to fulfill your own personal PD goals (#100DaysOfX) and will share the progress I’ve made during my own #100DaysOfCode journey.
